# littlechallengeofcursoemvideo
A Html and CSS challenge. From a course that I'm doing.
I've needed to create some page indicating some courses to whom wants be a programmer student.
Any course must be one introduce video that link with other page.
THis other page have a quick video talking about the course, a link that opens a new page to the student could watch the full course through the playlist.
Have the option to go back to the first page either.
CSS and Footer I wants add to give let more interesting the exercise and because I really can't create a page without CSS (even the basics).
Hope you enjoy the simplicity and get some inspiration maybe.
